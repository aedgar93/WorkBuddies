### Delete
1. Create a .env.delete file
1. Add COMPANY_ID to .env.delete with the company you would like to delete
1. Add GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS to .env.delete with the path to your service account key
1. Optional, add the PROJECT variable to .env.delete. It will default to staging if no var is set (Make sure PROJECT matches the service account file)

Example .env.delete and service account files can be found in last pass
